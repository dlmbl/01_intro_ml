In this exercise, we are going to follow the basic workflow that is the foundation of any machine or deep learning project
1. Data wrangling
2. Model configuration and training
3. Model evaluation

Along the way, we will implement a linear classifier, test a random forest classifier and explore the role of feature engineering in traditional machine learning.

We are going to look at a collection of images of Jurkat cells published in the Broad Bioimage Collection ([BBBC048](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC048)). The cells were fixed and stained with PI (propidium iodide) to quantify DNA content and a MPM2 (mitotic protein monoclonal #2) antibody to identify mitotic cells. The goal is to predict the stage of the cell cycle from images like those shown below.

# Part A: The Linear Classifier

While deep learning might seem intimidating, don't worry. Its conceptual underpinnings are rooted in linear algebra and calculus - if you can perform matrix multiplication and take derivatives you can understand what is happening in a deep learning workflow. In this section, we will implement a simple linear classifier by hand and train it to predict cell cycle stages.

## The supervised machine learning workflow
Recall from class the conceptual workflow for a supervised machine learning project.
- First, we create a <em>training dataset</em>, a paired collection of raw data and labels where the labels contain information about the "insight" we wish to extract from the raw data.
- Once we have training data, we can then use it to train a <em>model</em>. The model is a mathematical black box - it takes in data and transforms it into an output. The model has some parameters that we can adjust to change how it performs this mapping.
- Adjusting these parameters to produce outputs that we want is called training the model. To do this we need two things. First, we need a notion of what we want the output to look like. This notion is captured by a <em>loss function</em>, which compares model outputs and labels and produces a score telling us if the model did a "good" job or not on our given task. By convention, low values of the loss function's output (e.g. the loss) correspond to good performance and high values to bad performance. We also need an <em>optimization algorithm</em>, which is a set of rules for how to adjust the model parameters to reduce the loss
- Using the training data, loss function, and optimization algorithm, we can then train the model
- Once the model is trained, we need to evaluate its performance to see how well it performs and what kinds of mistakes it makes. We can also perform this kind of monitoring during training (this is actually a standard practice).

Because this workflow defines the lifecycle of most machine learning projects, this notebook is structured to go over each of these steps while constructing a linear classifier.

How do we know how well our model is doing? A common practice to evaluate models is to evaluate them on splits of the original training dataset. Splitting the data is important, because we want to see how models perform on data that was not used to train them. We split into
- The <em>training</em> dataset used to train the model

There are several ways to correct class imbalance. In this example, we are going to oversample underrepresented classes until we have an equal number of samples for each class.

It's important to note that we need to correct class imbalance after generating the train/test split in our dataset. When we are oversampling, we want to prevent samples that are used in our training dataset from also appearing in our testing dataset.

### One-hot encoding

Currently, our data have labels that range from 0 to 6. While we know that each of these 7 classes is comparable, this encoding implies that some classes have more weight than others. Alternatively, we want to use a binary encoding so that all classes are seen as equivalent by the model.

Instead of representing each label with a number from 0 to 6, we will use an array of length 7 where each position in the array is a binary value encoding the class.

## The linear classifier
The linear classifier produces class scores that are a linear function of the pixel values. Mathematically, this can be written as $\vec{y} = W \vec{x}$, where $\vec{y}$ is the vector of class scores, $W$ is a matrix of weights and $\vec{x}$ is the image vector. The shape of the weights matrix is determined by the number of classes and the length of the image vector. In this case $W$ is 7 by 4356. Our learning task is to find a set of weights that maximize our performance on our classification task. We will solve this task by doing the following steps

## Stochastic gradient descent
To train this model, we will use stochastic gradient descent. In its simplest version, this algorithm consists of the following steps:
- Select several images from the training dataset at random
- Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, given the selected images
- Update the weights using the update rule $W_{ij} \rightarrow W_{ij} - lr\frac{\partial loss}{\partial W_{ij}}$

Recall that the origin of this update rule is from multivariable calculus - the gradient tells us the direction in which the loss function increases the most. So to minimize the loss function we move in the opposite direction of the gradient.

Also recall from the course notes that for this problem we can compute the gradient analytically. The gradient is given by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial loss}{\partial W_{ij}} = \left(p_i - 1(i \mbox{ is correct}) \right)x_j,
\end{equation}
where $1$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the statement inside the parentheses is true and 0 if it is false.

A complete derivation of $\frac{\partial loss}{\partial W_{ij}}$ is included in the Towards Data Science [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-softmax-function-and-the-categorical-cross-entropy-loss-ffceefc081d1) recommended above if you are interested in the details.

Decisions trees are a useful tool for generating interpretable classification results. As shown in the example below, trees are constructed such that the data is split at each node according to a feature in the data. At the bottom of the tree, the leafs should correspond to a single class such that we can predict the class of the data depending on which leaf it is associated with.

A random forest classifer is much like what it sounds. It takes predictions from many different decision trees and assigns the class with the most votes. Ultimately this ensemble method of considering many different trees performs better than any one decision tree.

## Introduction to image filters

Image filters operate by taking a small kernel (or matrix) and applying it to each pixel in the image to compute a new value. For example, this 3x3 kernel will sharpen an image

    -1 & 5 & -1 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 \\

Filters can produce a variety of effects on images depending on how the kernel is configured. This can range from blurring an image to extracting edges. Filtered images can contain data that is more informative to the model when distinguishing between classes.

#### Task 5.1

Test a variety of the available filters from the `skimage` module. Whenever you are making a modification to an image, you should check the results to make sure that errors are not introduced while generating the transformation. The easiest way to plot an image is just to run `plt.imshow(image)`.

Ultimately we are going to use model performance to select the best features for our classification task, but you should be familiar with the output of any filters that you are using. The goal of this next section is to identify a set of candidate filters from which one will be chosen that you think will lead to better classification results on the two classes we are trying to distinguish.

Keep the following things you may want to keep in mind as you approach this problem
- Look at several randomly selected images from the different classes when you are testing a filter
- Explore the effect of parameters available for each filter

**Challenge**: While this task could be approached by testing filters one at a time, consider writing a for loop to rapidly test filters in an automated fashion.

#### Task 5.2

Your challenge now is to combine the features that you have explored with one of the two models we've trained so far. It's up to you to select a set of features and model design that you think will produce the best results. We'll compare results as a group at the end.

As you approach this task, you are encouraged to copy/paste code from earlier in the exercise and modify it as needed. Here's a rough outline of what you will need to do:
- Build a new dataset with your selected filters. The easiest way to combine data from multiple filters is to concatenate images together along the axis corresponding to the image size. For example if our initial training data has the shape `(n_images, image_width * image_width)`, the new data will have the shape `(n_images, n_filters * image_width * image_width)`. Here's a code snippet to get you started:
```python
# Select single image (10) and channel (0)
im = X_data[10, ..., 0]
gaus = skimage.filters.gaussian(im)
lapl = skimage.filters.laplace(im)

# Flatten each image
im = np.reshape(im, (image_width * image_width))
gaus = np.reshape(gaus, (image_width * image_width))

- Finish assembling your dataset by splitting into train/test split (`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`), balancing classes (`imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`) and one hot encoding (`sklearn.label_processing.LabelBinarizer`)

- Configure your model. If you choose the `LinearClassifier` make sure you update the `image_size` parameter to match the dimensions of your new dataset.

- Train and evaluate the results
